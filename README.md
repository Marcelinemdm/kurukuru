# Herta Kuru Clone

This is a clone of the [Herta Kuru](https://github.com/duiqt/herta_kuru) repository that I created after seeing it on a random user's Discord server.

## Introduction

This project is a clone of the original [Herta Kuru](https://github.com/duiqt/herta_kuru) repository. It replicates the functionality and features of the original project. I was inspired to create this clone after coming across the project on a random user's Discord server. The goal of this clone is to explore and understand the codebase of the original project and potentially contribute to it in the future.
